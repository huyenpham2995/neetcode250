Time for me to review all the sort algorithm I know.

## Bubble Sort
The slowest of them all. 
- Start with the first number. Check other numbers to see if anything is smaller than that number. If they are, swap.
- Continue to the next number and repeat the same thing from i+1 position.
- Do it until reaching the end of the array

## Selection Sort

## Merge Sort

## Heap Sort

## Quick Sort

# BigO
## Bubble Sort

- Space: in place, O(1)
